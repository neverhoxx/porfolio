                        You can safely leave a request ✉️ on my website or by writing to me by email without having a ready-made technical task. After discussing the details of the project and identifying your needs taking into account all your wishes, I will draw it up for you as part of the website development. ☝️ If the technical task is drawn up clearly and in detail, I will understand the tasks set before us. This means that the result will satisfy both you and me.

                        Of course ✅ Moreover, I am not limited by time frames, but provide project support indefinitely. You can contact me at any time after the development of your site for any adjustments or for advice.

                        <span className="text-red-700">! IMPORTANT</span>: technical support involves troubleshooting website elements or functionality that were provided for in the terms of reference. ☝️ If after the development of the site you want to add new visual or functional elements - this is considered a separate front of work, which is also estimated separately.

                        No problem ✅ I do both individual types of work, such as: design, layout, integration with CMS, writing or translating text, and comprehensive development of turnkey websites. When implementing a separate stage of work, I will contact your specialists and discuss all technical issues ☝️ so that their further work is as comfortable and productive as possible. To discuss your task, write to me ✏️ or leave a request.
